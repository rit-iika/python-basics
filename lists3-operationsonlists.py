#operations with lists
#1 concatinating strings
# we can create a new list by adding two lists
a=[1,2,3,4,'heya']
b=[5,6,7,8,'hola']
c=a+b
print(c)
#2 lists can be sliced 
d=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(d)
print(d[:5])
print(d[2:4]) #remember---- second number is upto but not including
# many operations are quite similar to strings. 
# append adds a thing to end of list
# len tells you how many things are there in list
# count tells how many things that match a particular thing are in list
# extend, index, insert, pop,remove etcetc
